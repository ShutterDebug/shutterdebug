New Start
Posted on January 10, 2013 by r
Alright! So after registering this domain last year, I designed a nice page layout on Photoshop and then prototyped it in HTML, but never had actual time to convert that to a full-on blog. Â School got crazy, and the challenge of building my own blogging solution in NodeJS seemed too much trouble for what it was worth, so it kinda just sat there.

Shutter Debug Design

My old site design. Â Hopefully the new one will be even better!

Since then, I’ve decided that over-engineering is pointless (as it should be in any sensible project). Why should I build something that WordPress already does, when what I build would be a lot less functional and take up time I could be actually blogging? Â I mean, that’s what blogging is about right? Â Writing the articles, collecting interesting work, not re-building WP. Â So, here I am.

Enough blabber, and on with the good stuff. Â This blog, aptly named “Shutter Debug”, will be my new way to create, collect, and share my insights and projects on three of my hobbies + interests:

Photography
Technology, Code Projects, Design, etc
Food!
The first thing to do now is to find a decent WP layout and start working off of it! Â I’m not a huge fan of default layouts and I feel like too many of them have Flash… so I’ll be looking for a simple layout utilizing Responsive Web Design (more on this later), and modifying it from there for my needs :)

I will also beÂ imploringÂ the help of a few of my friends with similar interests in writing some articles and working on site design, so stay tuned for their input!
