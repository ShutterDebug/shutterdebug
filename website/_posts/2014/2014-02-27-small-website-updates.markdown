It's been a month and a bit before I last blogged on this site, but that doesn't mean the work has stopped!  Since my last blog entry, I spent some time getting navigation links at the top of the page to work, paying careful attention to how the page looks at different resolutions.  I know that the last time I mentioned something like 5 different screen resolutions I would like to target, but for now, I've stuck to 4.  If you try and resize the page horizontally from 1440px+ wide to <599px, you'll notice the navigation link icons rearrange, resize, and then the page margins retract and disappear.  Getting stuff lined up was difficult!

Also, today I added some banner images for each of my pages.  After much deliberation I decided to go with the 2.5:1 ratio, to make sure it's not covering my page content too much, but still big enough to show an interesting image.  These are all very special images to me, and I'll be explaining them in another blog post later!
<!--excerpt-->

Immediate TODOs:
- Add text to my banners for the sections they represent
- Add page titles to each page underneath the banners

Secondary TODOs:
- Add blog entry about the banners and their stories
- Add image scroller for the banner!

Cheers!
