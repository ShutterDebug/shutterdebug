Wow, it's been a while since I touched this site. Originally I had planned for this site to be my blogging outlet and showcase for personal projects, photography, and all my other interests.  I started with WordPress with intentions to focus on the content rather than creating the site itself, but school quickly got in the way and as a result I haven't touched this in a while.

<!--excerpt-->

In the mean time my WordPress blog got hacked and defaced because of vulnerabilities within WordPress itself and the theme I was using, and it got riddled with spam from WordPress crawlers writing irrelevant comments.  To add insult to the injury, when I looked for support regarding the matter, it seems like this is something common with WordPress sites running third-party themes!

In short, I got fed up.  I talked to a college who started his site around the same time I did:  He used the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) framework to build his blog, and it turned out pretty well.  He told me that many portions of WordPress were black boxes (not meant to be touched), and it makes customizing difficult, with a large learning curve.  The fact that I didn't know any PHP made everything that much more cryptic.  Since Jekyll is based off of HTML and Javascript, both of which I already know, this should be much easier (some assembly required).  You can visit his site at [hanjun.me](http://hanjun.me).

So, here I am.  I don't currently have other software projects under way at the moment besides Fourth Year Design Project, so this site is going to be my new project!  I've been reading up on Jekyll over the winter break, and now I have my first blog entry!

My goal here with this site are to achieve the following:

1. Learn Git.  I can't believe I'm in 4th year Engineering and I still haven't used Git.  I already know Mercurial, SVN, and Perforce though!
2. Learn Jekyll and its associated technologies.  This includes stuff like Markdown, etc.
3. Blog about my projects, photography, technology/reviews, and anything else I might find interesting enough to share
4. Hone my web-dev skills!  Responsive Web Design++

I'll continue building the blog throughout the next while, and see where this takes me!

Happy new year everyone!
